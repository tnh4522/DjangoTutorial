## Project Overview
This project is built using Django and Django REST Framework to provide a RESTful API for [specific use case or application]. It offers endpoints for [describe features such as user management, CRUD operations, etc.].

## Features
- Fully functional REST API.
- Token-based authentication (using Django REST Framework's Token Authentication or JWT).
- API for managing resources such as [list of models/resources].
- Custom permissions and user roles.
- Paginated responses for large data sets.

## Technologies Used
- **Django**: Python web framework for building the backend.
- **Django REST Framework**: Toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
- **PostgreSQL**: (or SQLite) Database management system.
- **JWT Authentication** (optional): For secure token-based authentication.
- **Docker** (optional): For containerization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x (or your version)
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL or SQLite (or any other DB you're using)

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/django-rest-framework-project.git
cd django-rest-framework-project
```

### Set up a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file at the root of your project to store sensitive information like database credentials and secret keys.
Example `.env` file:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/db_name
```

### Migrate the database
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a superuser
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Running the development server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## API Endpoints
Here is a list of key API endpoints:

### Users
- `POST /api/users/` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/users/login/` - Login and obtain a token
- `GET /api/users/profile/` - Get user profile details

### Example Resource (e.g., Products)
- `GET /api/products/` - Retrieve a list of products
- `POST /api/products/` - Create a new product
- `GET /api/products/<id>/` - Retrieve a specific product by ID
- `PUT /api/products/<id>/` - Update a product
- `DELETE /api/products/<id>/` - Delete a product

### Authentication
This project uses Token-based or JWT authentication (depending on your setup).

For Token-based authentication:
1. Obtain a token via the login endpoint:
   ```bash
   POST /api/token/
   ```
2. Include the token in the Authorization header for protected requests:
   ```bash
   Authorization: Token <your_token>
   ```

For JWT-based authentication, you can use the following steps to obtain and refresh tokens.
